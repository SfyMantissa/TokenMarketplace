# Token Marketplace ðŸ’°

A mock ERC-721/ERC-1155 marketplace.

## Features

This project includes 4 separate contracts:

  - Ryuuko.sol â€” a mock ERC-721 token.
  - Satsuki.sol â€” a mock ERC-1155 token.
  - YetAnotherCoin.sol â€” a ERC-20 token which is used to pay in the marketplace, [taken from my previous project.](https://github.com/SfyMantissa/YetAnotherCoin)
  - Marketplace.sol â€” the marketplace contract itself.

Marketplace is allowed to mint Ryuuko and Satsuki tokens using [OpenZeppelin Access Control.](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control)
